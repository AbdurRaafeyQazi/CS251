CS251 - Data Structures and Algorithms
Author: Abdur Raafey Qazi
📌 Overview
This repository contains my coursework for CS251: Data Structures and Algorithms at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). It includes various labs and projects that explore fundamental and advanced data structures, algorithms, and their applications in C++.

📂 Repository Structure
Labs
The labs introduce and reinforce key data structures and algorithms, with hands-on implementation. Each lab focuses on different concepts such as:

Lab 01-12: Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, graphs, and sorting algorithms.
Projects
The projects are more in-depth implementations that require problem-solving and efficiency optimizations:

Project 1 (Search Algorithms) – Implementation of binary search and other search techniques.
Project 2 (Graph Search) – BFS & DFS traversal in graphs.
Project 3 (Canvas List) – Custom implementation of a linked list-based UI system.
Project 4 (Priority Queue - BST) – Implementation of a priority queue using a binary search tree.
Project 5 (OpenStreetMap Routing) – Utilizing graph algorithms for pathfinding in real-world maps.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
Concepts Covered: Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Graph Theory, Trees, Sorting & Searching Algorithms
