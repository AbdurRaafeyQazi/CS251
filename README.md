# CS251 - Data Structures Labs & Projects

## Overview
This repository contains all the labs and projects for CS251 (Data Structures) at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). It serves as a structured collection of starter code, notes, and completed assignments that explore fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to a specific lab or project:

### **Labs**
These are structured exercises focusing on fundamental data structures and algorithmic concepts:
- `lab01-starter` - Introduction to C++ and basic data structures
- `lab02-starter` - Linked Lists and memory management
- `lab03-starter` - Stacks and Queues implementation
- `lab06-starter` - Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
- `lab09-starter` - AVL Trees and self-balancing properties
- `lab10-starter` - Graph representations and basic graph algorithms
- `lab11-starter` - Graph traversal techniques (BFS & DFS)
- `lab12-starter` - Advanced tree structures and applications

### **Projects**
Larger, more comprehensive assignments that apply multiple concepts from the course:
- `proj1-search-starter` - Implementation of search algorithms (linear & binary search)
- `proj2-search-starter` - Advanced search techniques and optimizations
- `proj3-canvaslist-starter` - Implementation of a linked list-based graphical application
- `proj4-prqueue-starter` - Implementation of a priority queue using a binary search tree
- `proj5-osm-starter` - Working with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data structures and algorithms
- `p5cpy` - Additional implementation related to Project 5

### **Notes**
- `notes` - Contains lecture notes and additional study materials for reference

## Getting Started
### **Cloning the Repository**
To clone the repository, run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AbdurRaafeyQazi/CS251.git
```

### **Compiling & Running Code**
Each lab and project has its own `Makefile` or build instructions. Navigate to the respective directory and compile using:
```sh
make
./program_name
```

Alternatively, if a Makefile is not provided, compile using g++:
```sh
g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
./output_file
```

### **Dependencies**
Most projects are written in C++ and require a standard compiler such as `g++`. If you are using Linux or macOS, install it with:
```sh
sudo apt install g++   # Ubuntu/Debian
yum install gcc-c++    # Fedora
brew install gcc       # macOS
```

## Contributions
This repository is maintained for personal reference and learning purposes. Contributions are welcome through pull requests if they align with the course material.

## License
This repository is for educational purposes and follows UIC's academic integrity policies. Do not submit this code as your own work in the course.
